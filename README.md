# Line Segment Intersection

## Exercise 1

You are given two line segments $l_1(t)$ and $l_2(t)$ on a plane defined by the following parametric equations:
$l_1(t_1) = \vec{a} + t_1\vec{v}$, where $0 \leq t_1 \leq 1$, and $l_2(t_2) = \vec{b} + t_2\vec{u}$, where $0 \leq t_2 \leq 1$.

1. Write a condition in a form of an equation (or multiple equations) for $l_1(t)$ and $l_2(t)$ to intersect.
2. Assume $P(p_x, p_y)$ is an intersection point for the line segments $l_1(t)$ and $l_2(t)$.
   Derive and write a formula that calculates $P(p_x, p_y)$.

## Exercise 2

Write a program that, given four points $A(x_a, y_a)$, $B(x_b, y_b)$, $C(x_c, y_c$) and $D(x_d, y_d$) as an input,

1. draws the line segments $\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\overrightarrow{CD}$ on the screen
2. draws the intersection point of $\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\overrightarrow{CD}$ on the screen as a circle (if there exists one).



You must use the formula from the exercise 1.
